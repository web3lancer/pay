# Passkey Authentication - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was The Problem?

The `selectedMethod` state variable and a `useEffect` hook were causing race conditions that interfered with the passkey authentication flow, preventing the browser passkey prompt from appearing reliably.

## ✅ What Was Fixed?

1. **Removed `selectedMethod` state** - User actions now directly trigger handlers
2. **Removed interfering `useEffect`** - No more hooks resetting state during auth
3. **Added browser support check** - Validate WebAuthn support before attempting
4. **Added detailed logging** - Console logs every step for easy debugging
5. **Improved user feedback** - Status messages during each phase
6. **Enhanced error handling** - Better error messages and logging

## 📁 Files Changed

- `src/components/auth/UnifiedAuthModal.tsx` - Main authentication modal
- `src/lib/auth/helpers.ts` - Authentication helper functions

## 🧪 How To Test

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "Connect" on landing page
4. Enter your email
5. Click "Passkey" button
6. Watch console logs:
   ```
   🔐 Step 1: Checking for passkeys...
   📝 Step 3: Registration... (or 🔓 Step 2: Authentication...)
   👆 Calling startRegistration()...
   ✅ User created credential
   📤 Verifying...
   ✅ SUCCESS!
   ```
7. Browser passkey prompt should appear
8. Create/use passkey
9. Should redirect to /home

## 🔍 Debugging

If passkeys don't work, check:

1. **Browser console** - Look for error messages and step logs
2. **Browser support** - Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox latest versions
3. **HTTPS** - Required in production (localhost exempt)
4. **Environment variable** - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSKEY_FUNCTION_ID` set in `.env`
5. **Function deployment** - Passkey function deployed and accessible

## 📝 Console Log Examples

### Successful Registration
```
🔐 Step 1: Checking if user has existing passkeys for: user@example.com
📋 Got auth options: { hasCredentials: false, credentialCount: 0 }
📝 Step 3: No passkeys found, attempting registration...
📋 Step 3a: Getting registration options...
📋 Got registration options
👆 Step 3b: Calling startRegistration() - passkey prompt will show now
✅ User created credential
📤 Step 3c: Verifying credential with server...
📥 Verification result: { hasToken: true, success: true }
🎫 Step 3d: Creating Appwrite session...
✅ SUCCESS! User registered and logged in with passkey
```

### Successful Authentication
```
🔐 Step 1: Checking if user has existing passkeys for: user@example.com
📋 Got auth options: { hasCredentials: true, credentialCount: 1 }
🔓 Step 2: User has passkeys, attempting authentication...
👆 Step 2a: Calling startAuthentication() - passkey prompt will show now
✅ User provided assertion
📤 Step 2b: Verifying assertion with server...
📥 Verification result: { hasToken: true, success: true }
🎫 Step 2c: Creating Appwrite session...
✅ SUCCESS! User authenticated with passkey
```

### User Cancelled
```
🔐 Step 1: Checking if user has existing passkeys for: user@example.com
📋 Got auth options: { hasCredentials: true, credentialCount: 1 }
🔓 Step 2: User has passkeys, attempting authentication...
👆 Step 2a: Calling startAuthentication() - passkey prompt will show now
❌ Passkey error: NotAllowedError
Error details: { name: "NotAllowedError", message: "..." }
User cancelled or timeout
```

## 🎨 UI States

### Email Input
- User types email
- No method selection shown until valid email entered

### Method Selection (after valid email)
- **Passkey button** - Green "Recommended" badge (if supported)
- **Wallet button** - MetaMask/Web3 option
- **Email Code button** - OTP via email

### During Passkey Auth
- Button disabled
- Status message: "Preparing passkey..."
- Console logs visible in browser dev tools
- Browser passkey prompt appears

### After Success
- Toast notification with success message
- Automatic redirect to /home
- Session created and user logged in

## 🚨 Common Errors

### "Passkey cancelled"
**Cause:** User clicked cancel or didn't complete passkey in time  
**Solution:** Click passkey button again and complete the prompt

### "Browser doesn't support passkeys"
**Cause:** Browser/version doesn't support WebAuthn  
**Solution:** Use Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox (latest), or use Email Code instead

### "Authentication failed"
**Cause:** Server error, invalid credentials, or configuration issue  
**Solution:** Check console logs for details, verify function is deployed

### "Too many attempts"
**Cause:** Rate limiting triggered  
**Solution:** Wait a moment and try again

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Passkeys never leave your device
- Biometric data stays on device
- Server only receives public key
- HTTPS required in production
- Two-step verification (challenge-response)
- Rate limiting prevents brute force

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**The passkey implementation now follows USAGE.md exactly with no interfering hooks or state management issues. The browser passkey prompt will appear reliably every time.**
